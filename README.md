# project-3

The living in the 21st Century project analyzed the rising costs of living expenses across the globe.  We examined inflation rates per country and the average price people pay for goods and services such as gas, housing and utilities.   
The two datasets selected for the analysis were “Global Cost of Living” from Kaggle which provided the average consumer expense cost per city and “Global Database of Inflation” from the World Bank which contained inflation rates per year, per country.
These datasets were extracted, cleaned and loaded into PGAdmin SQL server. Geojson and json files were then created to use as files in visual projections of the data in an HTML format.
